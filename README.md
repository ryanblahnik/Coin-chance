### Coin chance ###

> Press the button to flip a coin with pseudo-random results. Made with Express, Mongoose and AngularJS.
>
> Results are stored with time stamps and will persist until all records are cleared with the Delete history button. And since a crud app needs to update records too, go wild with the Cheat history button to pseudo-randomly choose one historical record and flip its outcome. Don't look at the server code; I will keep getting better. Usable on desktop or mobile.
